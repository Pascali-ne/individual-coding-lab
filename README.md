This project is an Individual Coding Lab solution for the Assignment
It includes a Python script grade-generator.py to calculate student grades interactively.
Assignments are categorized as Formative (FA) or Summative (SA) with weighted grading.
The script validates inputs, computes total grades, GPA, and pass/fail status.
A Bash script organizer.sh archives CSV files with timestamps and logs actions.
All results and CSV files are neatly organized for easy tracking and review.
